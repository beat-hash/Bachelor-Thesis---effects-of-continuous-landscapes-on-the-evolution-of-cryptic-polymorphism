# Bachelor-Thesis---effects-of-continuous-landscapes-on-the-evolution-of-cryptic-polymorphism
The codes and experiment data for my bachelor thesis

### Multi species library
Includes code to setup the ecological model and solve for steady-states, compute selection gradients, invasion fitness, ... 

### Landscapes library
Includes code to generate periodic perlin noise landscapes. 

### Two-patch model 
Includes code to solve and analyze the model from the two-patch Lotka-Volterra model. Used to create figure 3.4

### Graphix 
Code to generate graphics 

### Experiment A 
Used to generate the file ExperimentA.pkl IMPORTANT: GitHub does not accept large datafiles. I therefore split the file ExperimentA.pkl into five parts, which can be merged using the file mergedataframe.py 

### Experiment A star
Here the steps from Experiment A are repeated with the succesfull landscapes and an opportunity cost. Used to make the file ExperimentAstar.pkl 

### Experiment A star visualization 
Used to make graphic XY in the thesis. 

### Experiment B 
Used to make the graphic XY in the thesis.
